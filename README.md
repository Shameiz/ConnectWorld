PROJECT DESCRIPTION
The objective of the hack is to reduce the lengthy time process but honestly also the awkwardness of adding a new friend or colleague with their diverse social media platform by only word of mouth.The team has dreamt of eliminating this process by having a simple QR Code for each user to scan by a single snapshot with their camera in order to receive the person's social media platforms. We have built a website for new users and existing users to add their social media information, once uploading a QR Code is generated which can be shared with anyone which will direct them to a personal profile page with their information being displayed in an aesthetically pleasing manner. The way we hope to improve our hack beyond RU hacks is by creating a mobile app for both ios and android.
